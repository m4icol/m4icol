###
Hi! My name is Maickol Rivera and I began creating web pages for fun at the age of 15, never imagining it would become one of my greatest passions. Over time, I have expanded my skills, exploring JavaScript, Astro, and React.

Additionally, I learned to develop applications with Flutter for a school project. In this setting, I also acquired skills in programming with C++ and Java.
